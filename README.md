Cow Management System
🐮 Introduction
The Cow Management System is a web application designed to aid farmers in efficiently managing their cows’ health, milk production, and veterinary care.
It allows farmers to:

Create an account and login securely

Add cows to their farm’s profile

Record and track each cow’s milk production and health condition

Get in touch with a veterinarian directly from the platform if there are health issues with a particular cow

This application aims to enable data-informed decisions, improve herd health, maximize production, and foster strong relationships with veterinary care providers.
